Connect the GND of the connector and the PSU to one line (must be connected) - see PPTX for installation details.

mux is the name of the multiplexer, it can be read on the back of the scale boards (or take the UID of a scale and skip the last two digits). This is only valid for the e-nventory boards!


sudo apt install fswebcam

im env dann: python -m pip install rpi-lgpio


cam damit die IR cam funktioniert: piircam

für onewirebus (pt100):

 - one wire protokoll aktivieren unter Schnittstellen im Pi Manager
 - reboot
 - sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt:
    dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=26 (alle sensoren gehen auf den einen pin) anfügen am ende (=pullup wiederstand auf 26)

    Testen:
    This command loads the w1-gpio kernel module, which is responsible for enabling the GPIO pin for one-wire communication:

    sudo modprobe w1-gpio

    Then, the following line loads the w1-therm kernel module, which adds support for DS18B20-specific features, such as reading temperature data from the sensor.

    sudo modprobe w1-therm

    Then, change the current working directory to /sys/bus/w1/devices/. In this directory, it exposes information about connected one-wire devices, including the DS18B20 sensor (if it can find the sensor).

    cd /sys/bus/w1/devices/

    Finally, list the contents of the devices folder that should show one or more directories, each representing a one-wire device.

    ls

    In the case of the DS18B20 temperature sensor, you’ll see a folder like 28-xxxxxxxxxxxx, where xxxxxxxxxxxx is the unique address of your DS18B20 sensor.
    Navigate to the directory representing the DS18B20 sensor. For example, in my case it’s as follows (use the directory of your sensor):

    cd 28-03173311a0ff

    After navigating to the directory representing the DS18B20 sensor, you can use the cat command to read the contents of the w1_slave file. This file contains the raw temperature data in a specific format.

    cat w1_slave

    The contents of the w1_slave file will look something as shown in the next screenshot (first line contains the status of the reading: YES means a valid reading, and the second line shows the temperature (you need to divide by 1000 to get it in degrees Celsius).
